The mechanism behind it is fairly straightforward: users buy SCADS and hold it in their wallet. Then the (POH) triggers the minting of TWINE based on the proof that the wallet is holding SCADS. TWINE, a linear token, is minted automatically. Mapping is employed to precisely locate holder addresses, which are subsequently registered systematically on the list of network participants. Designated addresses automatically activate the POH function. This is a great opportunity for investing in much less risk than usual.",
